Project Overview
This project showcases a full-cycle analysis of an e-commerce dataset (Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist from Kaggle). 
It covers data cleaning, exploration, sales and customer segmentation analysis, visualization, and actionable business insights,
culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

1. Data Cleaning & Exploration

The first step focused on understanding the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
Key Steps Performed in Python (Jupyter Notebook / VS Code):
Handled missing and duplicate values in all tables (orders, customers, items, products, payments, reviews, sellers, geo).
Standardized column names and data types, especially for timestamps and numeric fields.
Filled missing values with medians, zero, or default strings as appropriate.
Explored basic trends, distributions, and dataset statistics to understand sales, product, and customer patterns.

📂 Cleaned Data Folder: 03_Cleaned_Dataset – cleaned CSVs ready for analysis

2. Customer & Payment Analysis

After cleaning the dataset, I performed detailed business analysis focusing on orders, payments, and customer behavior.
Analysis Performed:
Calculated Total Sales and Total Payments using DAX in Power BI measures.
Segmented orders by status (delivered, canceled, processing) and visualized proportions.
Explored payment types (credit card, boleto, voucher) and their distribution using Pie Charts.
Generated KPI cards for key metrics: Total Sales, Total Payments, Total Orders.

Product Performance & Top Categories

Next, I focused on analyzing products and categories to find the best-performing items.
Analysis Performed:
Computed Total Payment per Product Category.
Created Top 10 Product Categories by Revenue bar chart using Power BI.
Visualized product distribution and sales trends across categories and time.
Identified key product categories driving the majority of revenue.

4. Geographic Insights
To understand regional patterns:
Mapped customer and seller geolocations using Power BI map visuals.
Analyzed distribution of orders and sales across cities and states.
Identified regions with higher sales volume or delivery delays for business decisions.

Finally, I built a Power BI Dashboard to present all insights in an interactive, business-friendly format.
Dashboard Pages & Highlights:
Home / Overview: Quick KPI cards, slicers for filtering by date, payment type, or order status
Sales Performance: Total Sales, Total Payments, Total Orders with trend line charts
Product Insights: Top categories, product-level revenue breakdown
Customer Insights: Order segmentation, payment preferences, loyalty indicators
Geographic Insights: Maps showing order distribution and sales hotspots
Executive Summary: Key metrics and insights for business decision-making
